# RFM Modeling and Purchase Prediction

## Overview

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling is a powerful technique used in marketing and customer relationship management to analyze and categorize customer purchasing behavior. This project extends RFM modeling by incorporating logistic regression to predict customer purchase propensity.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is twofold:

1. **RFM Segmentation**: Utilize RFM modeling to segment customers based on their transactional history, identifying distinct groups to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer retention.
   
2. **Purchase Prediction**: Apply logistic regression modeling to predict the likelihood of customers making purchases. By analyzing RFM features along with other relevant variables, businesses can anticipate customer behavior and target promotional efforts effectively.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is located in the `Dataset` folder. It contains transactional data from an online retail store and provides the necessary information for RFM modeling and purchase prediction analysis.
