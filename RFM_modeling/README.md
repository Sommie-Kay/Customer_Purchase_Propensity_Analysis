# RFM Modeling 

## Overview

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling is a technique used in marketing and customer relationship management to analyze and categorize customer purchasing behavior. It segments customers based on three key metrics:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends on purchases.

This folder contains detailed representation for understanding the concept of RFM modeling and its application in analyzing customer purchasing behavior.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of RFM modeling is to segment customers based on their transactional history and behavior. By analyzing recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchases, businesses can identify high-value customers, target marketing efforts effectively, and improve customer retention strategies.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this RFM modeling tutorial is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data from an online retail store and provides the necessary information for calculating RFM scores and segmenting customers.
