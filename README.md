# Customer Purchase Propensity Analysis

## Introduction and Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase propensity using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling and logistic regression. It includes demonstrations of RFM modeling and logistic regression on both example and real datasets to provide insights into customer behavior and predict purchase likelihood.

## Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Segmentation**: Utilize RFM modeling to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, identifying distinct groups.
2. **Prediction**: Apply logistic regression modeling to predict the propensity of customers to make purchases.
3. **Insights**: Gain actionable insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns to inform business strategies and marketing campaigns.

## Project Structure

This project is structured into the following folders:

1. **RFM_modeling**: Contains materials for understanding the concept of RFM modeling.
2. **RFM_model_implementation**: Includes code and notebooks for implementing RFM modeling on real datasets, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying logistic regression modeling.
